<br>
As creator of your User ID, you are completely responsible for your identity and Emerald  will not tolerate offensive, obscene, or otherwise inappropriate user identities. If a User ID violates any part of these ToS, determined at the sole and absolute discretion of Emerald support staff, we may immediately, temporarily, or permanently ban such User ID from the Emerald or services, with or without notice or prior warning.<br>
<br>
